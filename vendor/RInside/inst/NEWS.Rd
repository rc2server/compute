\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.11 (2014-02-11)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Updated for \cpkg{Rcpp} 0.11.0:
    \itemize{
      \item Updated initialization by assigning global environment via
      pointer only after R itself has been initialized -- with special
      thanks to Kevin Ushey for the fix
      \item Updated \code{DESCRIPTION} with \code{Imports:} instead of
      \code{Depends:}
      \item Added correspondiing \code{importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)} to
      \code{NAMESPACE} 
      \item Noted in all \code{inst/examples/*/Makefile} that
      \cpkg{Rcpp} no longer a library argument, but left code for
      backwards compatibility in case 0.11.0 is not yet installed.
    }
    \item Added \code{--vanilla --slave} to default arguments for R
    initialization 
    \item Added a few more explicit #include statements in the \code{qt}
    example which Qt 5.1 now appears to require -- with thanks to
    Spencer Behling for the patch
    \item Added new MPI example with worker functions and RInside
    instance, kindly contributed by Nicholas Pezolano and Martin Morgan
  }
}

\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.10 (2012-12-05)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Adjusted to change in R which requires turning checking of the
    stack limit off in order to allow for access from multiple threads
    as in the Wt examples. As there are have been no side-effects, this
    is enabled by default on all platforms (with the exception of Windows).
    \item Added new \sQuote{threads} example directory with a simple
    example based on a Boost mutex example.
    \item Disabled two examples (passing an external function down)
    which do not currently work; external pointer use should still work.
  }
}
   
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.9 (2012-11-04)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Applied (modified) patch by Theodore Lytras which lets RInside
    recover from some parsing errors and makes RInside applications more
    tolerant of errors
    \item Added non-throwing variants of parseEval() and parseEvalQ()
    \item Modified Qt and Wt examples of density estimation applications
    to be much more resilient to bad user input
    \item On Windows, have RInside use R's get_R_HOME() function to get
    R_HOME value from registry if not set by user
    \item Added note to examples/standard/Makefile.win that R_HOME may
    need to be set to run the executables -- so either export your local
    value, or re-install RInside from source to have it reflected in the
    library build of libRinside
    \item Updated CMake build support for standard, armadillo and eigen
    \item Improved CMake builds of examples/standard, examples/eigen and
    examples/armadillo by detecting architecture
  }
}
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.8 (2012-09-07)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added CMake build support for armadillo and eigen examples,
    once again kindly contributed by Peter Aberline
    \item Corrected Windows package build to always generate a 64 bit
    static library too
    \item Updated package build to no longer require configure / configure.win to
    update the two header file supplying compile-time information;
    tightened build dependencies on headers in Makevars / Makevars.win
    \item Improved examples/standard/Makefile.win by detecting architecture
  }
}
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.7 (2012-08-12)}{
  \itemize{
    \item New fifth examples subdirectory 'armadillo' with two new
    examples showing how to combine \cpkg{RInside} with \cpkg{RcppArmadillo}
    \item New sixth examples subdirectory 'eigen' with two new examples
    showing how to combine \cpkg{RInside} with \cpkg{RcppEigen} 
    \item Prettified the Wt example 'web application' with CSS use, also added
    and XML file with simple headers and description text
    \item New example rinside_sample12 motivated by StackOverflow
    question on using \code{sample()} from C
    \item Added CMake build support on Windows for the examples
  }
}
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.6 (2012-01-11)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Correct Windows initialization by not using Rprintf in internal
    console writer, with thanks to both James Bates and John Brzustowski
    \item Update RNG seeding (used by tmpnam et al) to same scheme used by
    R since 2.14.0: blending both millisecond time and process id
    \item Added CMake build support for all four example directories as kindly 
    provided by Peter Aberline; this helps when writing RInside code
    inside of IDEs such as Eclipse, KDevelop or Code::Blocks
    \item Small update to standard examples Makefile for Windows permitting 
    to explicitly set i386 or x64 as a build architecture
  }
}
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.5 (2011-12-07)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Applied (somewhat simplified) patch by James Bates which restores
    RInside to working on Windows -- with a big Thank You! to James for
    fixing a long-standing bug we inadvertendly introduced right after
    0.2.0 almost two years ago
    \item New example embedding R inside a Wt (aka Webtoolkit, pronounced 
    'witty') application, mirroring the previous Qt application
    \item Qt example qtdensity now uses the new svg() device in base R; removed
    test for cairoDevice package as well as fallback png code
    \item Very minor fix to qmake.pro file for Qt app correcting link order
  }
}
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.4 (2011-04-24)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Minor code cleanups in initialization code 
    \item New example embedding R inside a Qt application, along with pro file
    for Qt's qmake providing a complete simple C++ GUI application
    \item New examples rinside_sample\{10,11\} based on questions on the
    r-help and r-devel mailing list
    \item Some improvements and simplifications throughout examples/standard 
    as well as examples/mpi/
    \item Added this NEWS files -- with entries below summarised from ChangeLog
    and the corresponding blog posts
  }

  }
}
\section{Changes in RInside version 0.2.2 (2010-03-22)}{
  \itemize{
    \item New operator[](string) lets RInside act as proxy to R's global
    environment so that we can R["x"] = 10 to assign; all the actual
    work is done by Rcpp::Environment
    \item No longer ship doxygen-generated docs in build
    \item Use std::string for all arguments inside throw() to help Windows build
    \item Default to static linking on OS X and Windows just like Rcpp does
    \item parseEval() now returns SEXP and has just a string argument for more
    functional use; it and void sibbling parseEvalQ() now throw exections
